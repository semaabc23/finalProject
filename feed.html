          You went out with your friends today and took plenty of pictures,
          especially a lot of staged candid photos. When you get back home, you
          go to post on your Instagram. You spend two hours choosing a picture,
          edit the lighting, add a filter, add grain so it lessens the ability
          to see the pimple on your cheek, spend another hour thinking of a
          funny and creative caption and send it to your friends to approve
          before posting. Then you assemble a group of actual candid moments and
          raw photos from the day, write out whatever caption that comes to mind
          and you post it on your finsta account without hesitation.

          As we construct the ideal profile of ourselves, we’re aware that we
          are responsible for creating a complete image of ourselves which
          consists of the feeds and timelines we manage on social media. On
          platforms such as Tinder and Bumble, it’s almost normal to create fake
          profiles. People are well aware that many of the profiles are
          essentially nonsense. People alter their images as much as they
          possibly can in order to appeal to others. They’re consciously
          constructing a desirable profile and excluding anything they don’t
          like about themselves. This is the case on other platforms like
          Facebook and Instagram as well. People post and share images and
          updates that they feel seem to enhance the appearance of their
          profile. The platform may be different, but the intent is basically
          the same, to display an enticing profile to others and grab their
          attention. .

                    often times, people construct their profiles to reflect a
                    version of themselves that they want to be seen as. they
                    have the ability to choose how others view them and they
                    take advantage of this and create a profile for themselves
                    that they want to convince others to believe are a true
                    representation of themselves.

          People fail to remember their past perfectly as they tend to only
          capture the happy moments and post those only. This further interferes
          with our own perception of our memories. We are convinced because we
          seem to be smiling and enjoying life in the pictures on our Instagram
          feeds or our Facebook memories. Elissa Gabbert discusses this idea of
          perception of ourselves in her essay, “Picture Yourself Happy”. She
          says taking photographs of herself allows for her to “confirm to
          myself that I am who I think I am.” However, as this image gets
          tampered with in the process of perfecting it to share with others, it
          loses the original value and becomes almost like a second, different,
          version of what actually happened. The image of ourselves we once
          wanted others to believe ends up convincing us and altering the truth
          of our past in a sense.
