          age of social media
        </div>
        <p class= "largeTexts">
          With every golden age, comes a dark age following it. Now that we have
          peaked in the social media age, are we approaching the dark age of it?
          Nearly 2.7 billion people around the globe are social media users.
          These accounts span a wide range of platforms ranging from Instagram
          to Twitter to Facebook. The recent years have been the golden years of
          social media with viral videos circulating the internet and social
          movements. Recently, however, there’s been a surge of negativity
          across social media as people are becoming more and more reliant on it
          and living through social media rather living with social media.

          how social media dictates our day to day life
        </div>
        <p class= "largeTexts">
          Social media has grown past just a means of communication, it has come
          to dictate nearly every aspect of our lives. People rely on it to not
          only socialize, but to seek a romantic partner, date, form sexual
          relationships, and even find careers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Especially recently with a global pandemic driving many to resort to
          communicating and socializing remotely, people have become more
          reliant on social media than ever before. Every day we interact with
          carefully curated profiles which don’t completely portray the person
          behind the account.

          the problem
        </div>

        <p class= "largeTexts">
          The race to make oneself seem more desirable on social media has led
          to a false sense of authenticity. People feel pressured to curate
          “ideal” identities for their social media and dating profiles as they
          are a part of a culture that is driven by competition to get the most
          likes, comments, and shares. In the end it is as if that are
          competeing to have the “perfect” feed/timeline that would reflect an
          "ideal" life that they want others to believe they are living while
          trying to mask what is real.
